ABOUT LIST IN PYTHON:
--------------------
List is predefined class name and belongs to LIST category data type, also called as Data structure in python.
List is used to store the collection of elemnts of either same type or different type or both.
list follows insertion order(ordered).
list is mutable because it allows item assignment and also the memory address remains same after updating the list.
We can create two types of list:
    a) Empty List ---> No elements or length is zero. --> Can be created using [] or list()
    b) Non Empty List --> One or more elements | length of a list is > 0

we can perform indexing/slicing operations on a list
We can use predefined functions to perform more operations on a list.

PREDEFINED FUNCTIONS A LIST ARE:

WORDS to Remeber the LIST functions easily.

######################
#    CARS PRIICCE    #
######################

count(elem) --> Returns the count of elements present in a list | 0 if the elem is not exist
append(elem) --> adds the element to end of the list
remove(elem) ---> removes the first occurences of a list | value error if the elemt is not exist
sort() --> Sort the elemenst in a ascending order as the reverse parameter set to False as lst.sort(reverse=False) |  lst.sort(reverse=True) sorts the elements in descedning order 

pop() and pop(index)  --> pop() removes the end of element from alist and retuns the same elemtn | pop(index) removes specified elemnt from the given index, indexerror if the index no in the rnage(0, len(lst) - 1)
index() --> returns the index of a given value
insert() --> inserts the element at specifiec index
copy() --> copy the list
clear() --> removes the elemts from a given list
extend() --> two merge one list into another
